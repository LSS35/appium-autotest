# Appium Mobile Automation Test Template

This project was created as an educational example for setting up mobile automation testing with Appium.

**Note:** Due to the lack of free cloud resources to run Android emulators, automated tests cannot be executed in CI at this time.

If you know of any free services or platforms where mobile tests can be run (other than local environments), please consider raising a PR or leaving an issue with detailed information.
